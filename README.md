## 🚀 Project Overview

This Smart Hospital System simulates an end-to-end emergency pipeline:
**Patient → Questionnaire → Triage (AI) → Ambulance Queue → Technician Dispatch**

### Key Features:
* **Real-time Dashboard:** The technician dashboard exhibits live update behavior without requiring a full page refresh.
* **Modern UI:** A beautiful, custom-animated UI featuring a deep blue gradient and glassmorphism (frosted glass) effects.
* **Integrated AI:** A built-in Gemini-powered AI chatbot is available to answer general health questions.

This system is suitable for research projects, tech demos, hackathons, and academic submissions.
